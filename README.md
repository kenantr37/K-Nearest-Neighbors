# K Nearest Neighbors
### A short summary of the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
KNN calls "the simplest algorithm" machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression.The algorithm makes predictions by calculating similarity between the input sample and each training instance. It calculates the distance between the new instance and it's neighbors and then decide the class of this instance from K nearest neighbors.

### Summary for my simple project
In my sample, there is a dataset which is about California Housing Prices I downloaded from Kaggle. Despite of the prediction, I wanted to look at accuracy of the prediction but as I saw, accuracy of the prediction could be off from high accuracy score when features' amount would be large. This is because, I could get much more proper accuracy from less rows features and in my project's dataset there are 20433 rows. Probably it's my mistake but I'm learning :)

#### This is my sample with 20433 lines rows :

#### and this is my previous sample which has 500 lines rows . Prediction accuracy is quite normal :)
